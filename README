MODS::Record is intended to become a Perl module to support
easy creation, parsing and manipulation of MODS records.

The current state is PRE-ALPHA ! 

When a certain level of maturity is reached, the module will
be released to CPAN, too.

This is - hopefully - going to be my first CPAN module.
It is also my first encounter with Moose and PRANG.
Any feedback with tips for improvement will therefore be
highly appreciated...
